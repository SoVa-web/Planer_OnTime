# Planer_OnTime

The "on time" event planner is designed to keep a diary of tasks that need to be completed, set deadlines for them, and describe what needs to be done. The scheduler helps you focus on the task, because for each task, you can turn on a timer to complete it.

When we both devices are connected to the network :
  - when we start the timer on one of the devices on the other, we can see the timer already running and its status.
When the second device is not connected to the internet:
 - when it will connect to the internet, we compare the time on the timer and leave the one where more time has passed

- ability to register a user account and log in via Google;
